* **Welcome to the Burger App**

 * Create a burger and when you are ready, click the devour button to eat it.

It is that simple!

This app is a full-stack program that stores data on a database provided by Heroku, uses handlebars to display it's data, and uses the MVC structure.

* The MVC (Model-view-controller) is the structure of the application where the model talks to the database through the ORM's(Object Relational Mappers) I created, which then talks to the controller which in turn modifys the view.
